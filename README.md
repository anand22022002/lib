# Online Library Management System

## Objective
The objective of this task is to build REST APIs for a Library Management System.

## Description
The Online Library System allows anyone to create their own library. Each library has two types of user profiles:
- **LibraryAdmin**
- **Readers**

The **Library Owner** (creator) can onboard a **LibraryAdmin** directly and share a sign-up portal with **Readers**. The system currently supports only one LibraryAdmin per library.

Each book is identified uniquely using an ISBN number. The system maintains details of books, including versions, authors, and publishers.

## Profiles and Roles

### ✅ Admin:
- ➕ Add or Remove Books
- ✏️ Update book details (e.g., number of copies)
- 📜 List issue requests
- ✅ Approve or ❌ Disapprove issue requests
- 📖 Issue info for a Reader

### ✅ Reader:
- 📩 Raise an issue request for a book
- 🔍 Search books by Title, Author, or Publisher

### ✅ Owner:
- 🏛️ Create and manage libraries
- 👤 Create and manage Library Admins

## Database Info

### Tables:
- **Library**: (ID, Name)
- **Users**: (ID, Name, Email, ContactNumber, Role, LibID)
- **BookInventory**: (ISBN, LibID, Title, Authors, Publisher, Version, TotalCopies, AvailableCopies)
- **RequestEvents**: (ReqID, BookID, ReaderID, RequestDate, ApprovalDate, ApproverID, RequestType)
- **IssueRegistery**: (IssueID, ISBN, ReaderID, IssueApproverID, IssueStatus, IssueDate, ExpectedReturnDate, ReturnDate, ReturnApproverID)

## Flows

### User Authentication & Authorization
- Every user must pass their email address for authentication.
- Basic authentication ensures valid users exist in the database.
- Authorization is based on user roles.

### ✅ Library Owner Flows:
- 🏛️ **Library Creation** – Registers a new library with an Owner. Duplicate names are not allowed.
- 👤 **Create Admin** – The Owner can add a LibraryAdmin.

### ✅ Reader Flows:
- 🔍 **Search Book** – Readers can search by title, author, or publisher and check availability.
- 📩 **Raise Issue Request** – Readers can request books using the book ID and email. If unavailable, the request is rejected immediately.

### ✅ Library Admin Flows:
- 📚 **Add Books** – Adds books to inventory. If the book exists, the system increments the count.
- 🗑️ **Remove Books** – Decrements book count until 0. Issued books cannot be removed.
- ✏️ **Update Books** – Updates book details using ISBN.
- 📜 **List Issue Requests** – Admin lists issue requests.
- ✅ **Approve or ❌ Reject Issue Requests** – Sets approver ID, approval date, and updates issue registry accordingly.
